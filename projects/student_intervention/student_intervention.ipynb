    "**Answer: ** The three supervised models I am going to use are Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Trees:**\n",
    "Real world application - The simple twenty-questions game from mattel (https://www.amazon.com/Mattel-R8559-20Q-Version-3-0/dp/B0031ES9LE) is a fine example of a decision tree. It asks a series of questions each time dividing the set of possible answers, and trys to guess what you are thinking of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths - Decision trees are easy for people to understand. They do a pretty good job at classification assuming the underlying phenomenon are related to the data in a sensible way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses - Because they are easy to understand, it is also easy to draw false conclusions. For example, I heard of a situation where the ID number being above a certain threshold increased the rate of positives in a sample for a medical test. The real reason for that was that the location was encoded into the ID number, so the relevant data (location) was obscured by irrelevant information (ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate - We have some intuition about what's going on to contribute to a student needing intervention. However, our intutition may not be accurate so it as least worthwhile to investigate how well a decision tree can do, if for no other reason than to establish a baseline for our intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): **\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world application - KNN is sometimes used in stock price prediction, store purchase predictions, as well as some fraud detection and other security applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths - KNN costs nothing to learn up front, it is a \"lazy learner.\" In addition it does pretty well with a system where numerous factors interact determinitically but not in an extremely intuitive way. It is eseentially comparing something new to the \"most similar cases,\" but the similarities can easily be lost on people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses - Computational costs can be quite high if the number of distances we are computing is large and then number of neighbors is large. This can mean it is incrementally quite slow compared to other types of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate - KNN is a very versatile and this application is neither large nor high performance enough to be penalized greatly by the incremental computational as student interventions needs will likely not need to be calculated in real time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines (SVM): **\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world application - According to wikipedia, SVM's are used to classify proteins in biological applications. In addition, SVM's are like neural nets in that they are often used for numerous, numerous applications as it is a hip learning method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths - SVM's are very powerful, and do not suffer from the local optima issues that neural nets suffer from. They also allow for the representation of expert knowledge through kernal design. An explicit trade-off between complexity and error is possible and a lot more obvious than with some of the other more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses - Like many powerful models SVMs are not transparent so in this application (student intervention classification), though the model may be accurate, it will not be as intuitive as KNN or decision trees. They are fairly intensive models, so it is necessary to have sufficient data. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate - SVM's are a trendy model that is intensive and powerful. So it would be a great choice just as a comparison to KNN and a decision tree. A SVM is also a great a choice because, being opaque and non-intuitive, it might be accurate in ways that a person may not have thought intitially when looking at the problem. That could provide valuable insight into what is actually going on in the system."

    "**Answer: ** Well, we know that there are numerous factors that contribute to whether or not a student needs help with their studies. So, essentially we take those attributes and we plot out the students according to each attribute. Now, this is hard to visualize, but please bear with me. If we consider only the groups of very similar students, and of those only the groups that contain both students who need intervention and those who do not - that is how a Support Vector Machine looks at the world. Next it finds the best way to separate the very similar students who did and did not need intervention accross all of the different attributes. From there, it makes a generalized set of rules for how all the attributes interact and looks at each new student according to those rules to determine whether or not they need intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these rules we can imagine to be a function (or a line on a two dimensional plot) and the shape of that function(line) will be whatever shape maximizes the distance from each similar student in the edge cases (groups of similar students with both passing and not passing students within them). Imagine a group of children congregating in a group, and someone drawing a chalk line between the children such that the line is as far away as possible from each child. Now, the factors that contribute to passing and not passing are unfortunately not easily represented in two dimensions, and it is not easy for us to visualize more than three, but suffice to say these functions can all be represented together in a function of functions, and just as a multitiude of lines can be represented with a surface or plane, the multitude of funcitons in higher orders can be represented with what's called a hyperplane - unfortunately these are often extremely difficult to represent visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, all of these attributes we have collected on past students arrange them in a difficult to visualize higher order space. And, our SVM then finds the most similar students that both contain passing and non-passing students and separates them with a line that maximizes distance between both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before there was refrigeration and efficient transportation, the limit of what could be in a bouquet of flowers was what a person could afford, the flowers in one's limited area, and what flowers were in season. It would be impossible to visualize a bouquet of flowers containing flowers from different times, locations, and costs as they would be unattainable simultaneously. However, painters trained in realism would place flowers from different times and geographies in the same postition, in different places, at different times, carrying only the canvas with the unfinished portrait with them and paint a portrait of a bouquet that transcends location, cost, and time, allowing the viewer to look a the most beautiful bouquet without those restraints. With this the artist is creating a hyperplane through the space of geography, availability, and seasonality such that on one side of the hyperplane we have aesthetic in this bouquet and on the other non-aesthetic. I find this to be a fitting metaphor for what our SVM is doing."

All in all the score did not improve that much because the untuned model already scored quite high.
